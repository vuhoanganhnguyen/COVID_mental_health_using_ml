The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its  immediate aftermath present a serious threat to the mental health of Canadian residents. In this paroject, we utilize survey data from Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 2: Monitoring the Effects of COVID-19 and apply several statistical and machine learning models and techniques such as Chi-Squared Test, Bayesian Networks, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes to analyze the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Canadiansâ€™ mental health.
